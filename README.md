# Group-1-Project

## Running the Project##
After downloading all the files, there are a couple more required steps to run it.
First, you have to unzip the ```book-vec-group.csv.zip``` file into its csv form. This file stores all of the data for the books, but was too large to upload to github. After unzipping, place it in the ```project/static``` directory.

Then, you also have to download Flask, as well as scipy.stats. Then, you have to create a server from your computer. The way to do this is to first navigate to the ```project/``` directory, then typing ```export FLASK_APP=app.py``` in the terminal. Afterwards, typing ```flask run``` will give you a local host that you can copy and paste into your browser to view the website.
